### Implementation Notes
- Controller implemented in discrete time (Ts = 0.01 s)
- Actuator saturation included to model voltage limits
- Load disturbance applied at t = 2 s

### Engineering Insight
The controller maintains stability and restores motor speed despite load disturbances and actuator constraints, demonstrating robustness and suitability for embedded implementation.
